Introduction: Inthis assignment, I implement a rank flexible ODE solver to do simulation for a simle RC circuit and an amplifier
circuit. All the results are inincluded in the three folders Amplifier_similation, RC_simulation and Validation. As for the 
design of this program, there are overall four modules corresponding to the four classes. As for more detailed introduction,
you can find it in the Report.
