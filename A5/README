In this project, we simulate the "Boost Converter" circuit with ideal switch and its practial implementation with CMOS switch.
The ideal model is simulated using C++ while the other model is simulated using Java. The method used for solving ODE is RK34 
with adaptive time step. The codes for simulating the first model are included in the folder Model1, while the codes for the other
model are included in the folder Model2. For detailed introduction and analysis of the results, please read the report of the project
