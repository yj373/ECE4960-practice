Introduction:
This assignment is to implement a Jacobi iterative matrix solver. The main part of this assignment consists of three classes.
The firs class is "iterative_solver" which is used to implement the functions of the iterative solver. The second class "Tests"
includes all the test funtions used to test each module in the "iterative_solver". The thirs class is "main" which is used to 
load the huge sparse matrix and output the results using iterative solver. The outputs are resorded in three output files. When
the convergence threshold is 10^-7, the output file is output1. When the convergence threshold is 10^-8, the output file is 
output2. When the convergence threshold is 10^-9, the output file is output3. More detailed introduction is in the Report.pdf.

Notice:
In order to improve the efficiency and the reusavility of the codes. I create two helper methods to compute the product of two 
matrices and the product of a matrix and a vector. These two methods are also added to the SparseMatrix class in homework_4. In
the SparseMatrix class, I also added two methods used to compute the sum of two matrices and the difference of thwo matrices.
