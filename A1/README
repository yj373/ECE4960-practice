Coding language: Java     Platform: eclipse
My project consists of three different files and an output folder.
The first file A1.java is the main method of the whole project. In this file, the main method calls different methods to 
generate overflows and write the corresponding two-level reports.
The secod file Functions.java contains all the methods corresponding to the topics in the assignment.
The thid file Tests.java contains all the testing methods which are used to detect overflow, signed zero and so on.
The two-level reports are in the output folder. The reports are generated automatically by the program.
